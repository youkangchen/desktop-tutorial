You can read more about CSRF [here](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/csrf), but the TL;DR version is that they are cyber attacks that trick users into changing things on their account via forms. CSFR protects any POST request being corrupted by a hacker.\n",

In otherwords, \"UserForm\" is a custom class we have built, but it is a sub-class of the standard _FlaskForm_ solution. Our form contains a bunch of form fields we want the user to fill in of various types ... similar to datatypes in databases. The full list is:\n",

        "* email: an email address field\n",

        "Finally we have a new route/function to our final page (\"/form\" which leads to the \"templates/formpage.html\" file. Unlike in our previous examples here we specify two HTTP request methods - \"GET\" and \"POST\". The other pages have skipped this, which means defaulting to GET as the basic mechanism.

We also then have the form element, and in each case we have allocated a pixel size for that form.\n",

Because of this we run another for loop to go through each error associated with this label. In most cases (we hope) there will be no errors - so the for loop returns nothing.
